"""Stateless turn-mode classifier for role-instance dispatch.

A role's session can be called into action for several different kinds
of turn on the SAME work item. ``infer_turn_mode`` looks at the work
item's state (phase + metadata) and the queue entry type to return
one of five canonical modes. The prompt / context assembly branches
on this value so each mode gets the right context block injected.

    EXECUTE    — do the work yourself (leaf role, no children)
    DELEGATE   — break into subtasks (manager role, no children yet)
    REVIEW     — evaluate a subordinate's deliverable and emit a verdict
    INTEGRATE  — parent resumes after all children APPROVED; produce the
                 rolled-up deliverable for upstream review
    REWORK     — reviewer rejected your prior turn; address the feedback
    REPORT     — worker DONE; resume the same session under a dedicated
                 prompt to produce a structured handoff for the reviewer

The classifier is pure: given the same work item + queue entry kind,
it always returns the same mode. It does **not** load the store; all
state must be present on the work item (phase + metadata). This is a
deliberate tradeoff so the mode can be recomputed cheaply at any
point in the dispatcher or context-assembly path.
