"""Unified phase model for delegation work items.

A `Phase` is the single authoritative state of a delegation work item. It
replaces the previous mixture of `status` + 5 metadata sub-state fields
(activation_state / lifecycle_state / review_state / manager_release_state /
review_execution_state) which were tangled and could disagree with each other.

Design:
- One enum value per concrete situation a card can be in.
- Pure-function projections derive everything else (kanban column, owner,
  TaskStatus, runnability, verdict).
- A static transition table is enforced at every write.
- A **phase-transition hook** mechanism lets other layers (task.status,
  role_session.status, dispatcher wake signal, ...) subscribe to phase
  changes and synchronise themselves in one place. This eliminates the
  bug class where code forgot to update a dependent layer after
  transitioning a phase, leaving task/session state desynchronised from
  work-item phase.
