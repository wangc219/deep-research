"""Background sweeper that re-opens DONE tasks when new actionable mail arrives.

The company-mode end-of-turn hook (``_reactivate_for_unread_mail``) already
catches the common case where mail arrived *before* a task finished, but it
only runs at task-completion boundaries. When a DONE task's role receives a
blocking/actionable DM afterwards, nothing spontaneously wakes the role — in
previous versions of OPC the gap was hidden by a main-LLM "impersonation
reply" fallback that let the sender unblock but never involved the role's own
agent.

This sweeper closes the gap without introducing new abstractions: every few
seconds it re-scans DONE tasks for the active project and calls the existing
``reactivate_fn`` (which reuses all the guard logic in
``CompanyWorkItemExecutor._reactivate_for_unread_mail`` — fingerprint check,
depth cap, cross-role ping-pong detection). The scheduler then picks the task
up naturally and the external_broker's session-resume path hands the agent
back a fully contextualized codex/claude_code session.
