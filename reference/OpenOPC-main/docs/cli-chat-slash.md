# OPC Chat Slash Commands

`opc chat` includes an interactive slash console for managing context, sessions, runtime visibility, company work items, organization assets, and diagnostics without opening the Office UI.

The source of truth for this table is `_SLASH_COMMANDS` in `opc/cli/app.py`.

## Chat And Context

- `/help` shows the command table.
- `/quit` exits interactive chat.
- `/queue list|drop|clear` inspects or edits queued prompts while a turn is running.
- `/status` shows project, session, mode, agent, domains, model, cost, and external agent availability.
- `/mode [task|company] [corporate|custom]` changes how future natural-language messages run.
- `/agent [native|codex|claude_code|cursor|opencode|none]` sets or clears the preferred execution agent.
- `/domains [domain ...|clear]` sets or clears domain hints.
- Aliases: `/p` is `/project`, `/s` is `/session`, `/t` is `/task`, and `/checkpoint` is `/checkpoints`.

## Project And Session

- `/project` shows current project info and project command usage.
- `/project list|create|switch|rename|delete` manages project ids through the shared Office service.
- `/stop [task_id|session_id]` stops the current or selected runtime and preserves history.
- `/continue [task_id|session_id] [message]` continues a stopped runtime without re-planning.
- `/session` shows current session info and session command usage.
- `/session list|new|create|resume|show|config|send|rename|delete|stop|continue|complete` manages task-backed and plain chat sessions.
- `/session create [title] [--mode task|company|org] [--agent ...]` creates a task-backed session. `org` is a compatibility selector for Company Mode with a saved org architecture.

## Tasks And Runtime

- `/tasks [status] [--limit N] [--full]` lists project tasks.
- `/task show|move|done|rename|delete` inspects and updates persisted tasks.
- `/runtime [--limit N] [--full]` shows live runtime, active tasks, external sessions, and checkpoints.
